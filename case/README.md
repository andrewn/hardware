Case
----

A case suitable for laser cutter for making your own [radiodan](http://radiodan.net) case.

The case is designed to be laser cut out of 3mm thickness material.

There are 2 PDFs provided. The only difference is the width of the lines: 0.0001mm or 0.25pt. Which one you need to use depends on your laser cutter. The 0.25pt lines are easier to see in a graphics application if you need to edit the design.

We've used the following colours:

| Colour  | Action |
|---------|--------|
| RED     | Cut    |
| BLUE    | Score  |
| BLACK   | Etch   |

[Follow our instructions](http://radiodan.net/help/tutorials/make-a-case.html) to put it all together.
