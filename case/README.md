Case
----

A case suitable for laser cutter for making your own [radiodan](http://radiodan.net) case.

The case is designed to be laser cut out of 3mm thickness material.

Our current recommendation is to use the wide case format, with [this BOM](https://github.com/radiodan/hardware/tree/master/bom).

We've used the following colours:

| Colour  | Action |
|---------|--------|
| RED     | Cut    |
| BLUE    | Score  |
| BLACK   | Etch   |

[Follow our instructions](http://radiodan.net/help/tutorials/make-a-case.html) to put it all together.
